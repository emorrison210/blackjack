# blackjack
Blackjack is a popular casino card game where players try to beat the dealer by getting a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over. Each player is dealt two cards and can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand). Face cards are worth 10, aces can be 1 or 11, and the goal is to have a higher total than the dealer without busting.
